## State Machine Summary

The application defines 5 state machines but only **3 are actively used**:

| Machine                  | Status    | Purpose                     | Key States                                                              | Documentation                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enhanced Application** | ‚úÖ Active | Top-level orchestrator      | `initialization`, `idle`, `fileManagement`, `playerManagement`, `error` | [Reference](./STATE_MACHINE_REFERENCE.md#enhanced-application-machine) |
| **Sync Machine**         | ‚úÖ Active | Animation synchronization   | `idle`, `loadingFile`, `ready`, `error`                                 | [Reference](./STATE_MACHINE_REFERENCE.md#sync-machine)                 |
| **Player Machine**       | ‚úÖ Active | Individual player lifecycle | `uninitialized`, `initializing`, `ready`, `error`, `disposed`           | [Reference](./STATE_MACHINE_REFERENCE.md#player-machine)               |
| **Sync Coordinator**     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Multi-player coordination   | `idle`, `coordinating`, `offline`                                       | [Reference](./STATE_MACHINE_REFERENCE.md#sync-coordinator-machine)     |
| **File Manager**         | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | File operations             | `idle`, `validating`, `processing`, `error`                             | [Reference](./STATE_MACHINE_REFERENCE.md#file-manager-machine)         |

**Current Reality**: Sync coordination is built into the Sync Machine, and file management is handled by the Application Machine. The unused machines represent over-engineering.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why State Machines?

1. **Complex Synchronization**: Managing frame-perfect sync across multiple players
2. **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of failures at multiple levels
3. **Visual Debugging**: Clear mental model through state charts
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Explicit state transitions prevent bugs

### Why XState?

1. **Actor Model**: Built-in support for spawning and managing child processes
2. **Services**: Structured handling of async operations with cancellation
3. **DevTools**: Excellent debugging and visualization capabilities
4. **TypeScript**: Full type safety for events, context, and states

### Key Patterns

1. **Hierarchical Design**: Clear separation of concerns across machines
2. **Master-Slave Sync**: Single source of truth for consistent timing
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Loose coupling between machines
4. **Parallel States**: Independent concerns managed simultaneously

## Performance Characteristics

**Current Implementation:**

- **Sync Latency**: 16.67ms throttling (60fps) implemented in Sync Machine
- **Memory Management**: Basic cleanup (blob URLs, player disposal)
- **Error Recovery**: Simple retry logic in Player Machine (max 3 retries)
- **Logging**: Extensive console.log usage (27+ statements for debugging)

**Known Limitations:**

- No adaptive performance optimization
- No comprehensive metrics collection
- Fixed thresholds regardless of device capability
- Dual app architecture creates duplication
- Hard limit of 10 players (can be extended)

**Scaling Beyond Current Limits:**
See [SCALING_STRATEGIES.md](./SCALING_STRATEGIES.md) for detailed approaches to support 25, 50, 200+ players through progressive architecture improvements.

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Define states and events first
2. **Implementation**: Start with state machine, then React components
3. **Testing**: Test state machines independently, then integration
4. **Debugging**: Use XState DevTools for visual debugging

## Common Use Cases

### Adding a New Feature

1. Identify which machine should handle the feature
2. Add new events and states to the machine
3. Implement actions and guards
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update React components to use new events

### Debugging Issues

1. Check XState DevTools for current state
2. Verify event flow in sequence diagrams
3. Check guard conditions and context values
4. Review error states and recovery mechanisms

### Performance Optimization

1. Check for excessive state transitions
2. Verify throttling on frequent events
3. Profile context update efficiency
4. Monitor memory usage for resource leaks

## Contributing

When modifying state machines:

1. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation files
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Include unit and integration tests
3. **Consider Performance**: Evaluate impact on sync performance
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established patterns
5. **Update Diagrams**: Keep visual documentation current

## Support

For questions about the architecture:

1. Check this documentation first
2. Review XState documentation for general patterns
3. Use XState DevTools for debugging
4. Consult the team for architecture decisions

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated when:

- New state machines are added
- Significant state changes are made
- New architectural patterns are introduced
- Performance characteristics change
- Integration patterns evolve

_This documentation reflects the current state of the Lottie Sync Application architecture. Keep it updated as the system evolves._
